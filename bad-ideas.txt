The Big List of a2aaron's Really Bad Ideas (TM)

Things I Think Would Be Cool to Explore But Probably Aren't A Good Use of Time

[Bad Idea #1 - Busy Beaver BF Competition]
Write the longest running BrainFuck program that eventually terminates.
A program's score is number of steps taken. Input and output are ignored
(so no `.` or `,`) and the tape is the standard one (aka infinitely long,
only 8-bit signed cells, overflow allowed, and saturates when moving left
at the zeroth cell). Note that `[` and `]` DO count as executing a step since
these can modify the program's state. I'm gonna consider any program with
mismatched braces (ex: `[`, `+]` or `>+[>`) to be invalid programs.

You could have a version where input and output are allowed, but those wouldn't
be allowed to be infinite (I'd assume that the number of characters of input
plus the number of characters in the program should equal the total number of
characters allowed). EOF would also have to be specified, but that's a different
story all together.

Let BB_BF(n) be the number of steps that the longest running n-character BF
program executes. (Gonna ignore input and output)

BB_BF(1) is obviously 1 since the only programs are `+`, `-`, `>`, and `<`,
which all execute for 1 step and then end.

BB_BF(2) is 2. The only program with braces is `[]`, which jumps to the end of 
the program after the first step (one step executed). All other programs have no
loops and must end after 2 steps.

BB_BF(3) is 3. There are less than 6*6*6 = 216 possible programs,
but we can rule out some of the less interesting ones.

I will use `_` to represent "any non-loop character"

All programs with no `[` or `]` run for 3 steps.

`[_]` run for 1 step because the first cell is zero, so we just jump
to the end of the program instantly.

`[]_` runs for 2 steps. We jump after the `[]` and then execute the non-loop
instruction.

`+[]` and `-[]` does not finish, since we get stuck in the `[]`
and it never terminates.

`>[]` and `<[]` runs for 2 steps as we jump over the `[]`.

BB_BF(4) is 512.

`____` runs for 4 steps.

`[__]` runs for 1 step.

`[_]_` runs for 2 steps as the loop never executes.

`+[+]` and `-[-]` run for 512 steps (overflows after step 255)
`+[-]` and `-[+]` run for 4 steps.
`+[>]` and `-[>]` run for 4 steps
`+[<]` and `-[<]` do not finish

[🅱️ad Idea #2 - More 🅱️ Emojis]

We all know that 🅱️ is a popular meme at this point, but this leaves out all
of the non-English speaking users of the Internet. Thus, I propose adding a
🅱️ version of the following characters:
ß - U+00DF - Latin Small Letter sharp S
Ƀ - U+0243 - Latin Capital Letter B with stroke	
Ɓ - U+0181 - Latin Capital Letter B with hook
Ḃ - U+1E02 - Latin Capital Letter B with dot above
Ƃ - U+0182 - Latin Capital Letter B with top bar
β - U+03B2 - Greek Small Letter Beta	
Β - U+0392 - Greek Capital Letter Beta	
Б - U+0411 - Cyrillic Capital Letter Be
В - U+0412 - Cyrillic Capital Letter Ve
